    <h1>Imagine, Part 1</h1>
    <p>
      You wake up, and you don't know what's going on. You don't remember
      anything, you're scared, and you realize that you're in a metal box. You
      can see the top, and you're about to hit something... Bang! The loud noice
      of metal striking metal makes your ears ache. You cover them in the hope
      that this is all just a bad dream. You can hear faint noises of people
      talking and screaming. You're very confused by this. Suddenly, you can
      hear the loud creaking of the roof opening up above you.
      <br />
      The sun hits your eyes with its blinding, golden light. Once your eyes
      adjust to the sunlight, you can see a bunch of boys staring down at you
      from above. One of the boys jumps down and strides toward you. He puts his
      hands on his hips and says, "Welcome to the glade, greenie." You're
      confused and somewhat terrified. The words "greenie" and "glade" stuck out
      to you the most, as you have no clue what they mean. As you wonder what
      could possibly be happening over the akward silence, the boy sticks his
      hand out to help you up. Instead of taking the strange and unfamiliar
      boy's hand, you scoot into the corner of the box. The boys above you all
      start to laugh, well, all except one.
      <br />
      The only boy that didn't laugh jumped into the box. "Hello." he said. He
      had a funny accent that sounded vaguely familiar. You start to take notes
      on what he looked like; tall with blonde hair and blue eyes. You notice
      that he seems a lot nicer than the other boy. You are much more at ease
      now. He puts out his hand, and this time you grab it without questioning.
      "My name's Newt. Don't be scared. We aren't here to hurt you." he says.
      "I'm not scared anymore." You're shocked of what just came out of your
      mouth. You don't know why you just lied. Perhaps you don't want the others
      to know that you actually are scared. "We better get you out of this
      bloody box then." Newt replies.
